# CPP-relearn
This repository was created as I went over a recap of CPP syntax for the unit OOP. I had been writing code using Arduino(C/C++) for some time but I never learned the basics of the individual languages separately.
This was a good opportunity to get to understand most basic concepts that are usually overlooked.
